# Wonderland

🕳️🐇 **How would you and your friends use a 🥕carrot in a hackathon project?**

How would you incorporate a ⌨️keyboard, a 🧸stuffed animal, and maybe a JS library that only gives you ASCII 🐄cow art?

That's what you'll have to figure out in Wonderland.

**This winter, we’re limiting ourselves to the fabled *chest*** 🧰: a mysterious mish-mash of tools, parts, and useless libraries. From the finitudes of this chest, come the infinities of Wonderland.

So, for forty-eight hours in the heart of Boston, join me down this rabbit hole. Find your parts, tools, and libraries to create something truly wonderful. 

This winter, I’m getting lost. Will you?

[RSVP now!](https://wonderland.hackclub.com/)
See you in Boston on Feb. 17th - 19th!
